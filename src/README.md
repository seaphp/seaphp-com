# About Seattle PHP 

The Seattle PHP User Group (SeaPHP UG) is a volunteer-run PHP user group, and 
invites anyone with a desire to talk and learn about PHP and related 
technologies. We meet to share their knowledge, forge professional 
relationships, and promote the PHP community in the Seattle, WA, and Puget 
Sound area.

This group currently meets monthly to sharpen skills, network with other PHP 
developers in the area, learn new ideas and technologies, find jobs, and laugh. 
Check our meetup page regularly for details about each upcoming meetup.

In late 2016, Seattle PHP became a 501c3, not-for-profit organization.
