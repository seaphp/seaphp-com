# Temperance
__A Lightweight Wordpress Starter Theme__

Temperance is a virtue. It's about doing enough without doing too much. In a word - moderation.
Temperance provides a solid, modern foundation, without getting in your way.
Temperance is a WordPress starter theme. Most theme frameworks are usually either
too heavy or too rigid. On the other hand, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch.
Temperance is built using HTML5, with strong semantic markup, and progressive enhancement in mind. 
Because accessibility is essential for a modern, open web, Temperance strives to be accessibile by design. 
It's best to use Temperance when creating a new WordPress theme.
